## Description of Data Set:

The dataset our team selected comes from data.gov which is a US government website with a large catalog of datasets. Our dataset is the 2024 Fuel Economy Guide for the most common cars, SUVs, and trucks manufactured in 2024 driven in the United States, which includes domestic and foreign auto manufacturers. The database includes a wide variety of information for each manufacturer, division, and carline, which are all examples of string type data. Also, there are quantitative engine specifics like number of cylinders and intake/exhaust valves, numerical data. Additionally, the dataset lists city, highway, and combined fuel economy for each vehicle as advertised by the manufacturer, as well as drivetrain type and annual fuel cost. Finally, there is a column that lists the date the car was released, which is a date datatype. As a whole, the dataset offers comparable information on the different car manufacturers and how each has different numbers of vehicles with different specs, performance, and costs.
