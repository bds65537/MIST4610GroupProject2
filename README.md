## Description of Data Set:

The dataset our team selected comes from data.gov which is a US government website with a large catalog of datasets. Our dataset is the 2024 Fuel Economy Guide for the most common cars, SUVs, and trucks manufactured in 2024 driven in the United States, which includes domestic and foreign auto manufacturers. The database includes a wide variety of information for each manufacturer, division, and carline, which are all examples of string type data. Also, there are quantitative engine specifics like number of cylinders and intake/exhaust valves, numerical data. Additionally, the dataset lists city, highway, and combined fuel economy for each vehicle as advertised by the manufacturer, as well as drivetrain type and annual fuel cost. Finally, there is a column that lists the date the car was released, which is a date datatype. As a whole, the dataset offers comparable information on the different car manufacturers and how each has different numbers of vehicles with different specs, performance, and costs. 

## Question 1:

How does the number of cylinders in the engine affect the fuel economy across different drivetrain types?

Importance of this question: 
This question explores the relationship between engine specifications (specifically, the number of cylinders) and fuel economy, considering different drivetrain types such as Front-wheel Drive (FWD), Rear-wheel Drive (RWD), All-wheel Drive (AWD), and others. Analyzing this relationship can provide valuable insights into the impact of engine design on the efficiency of various vehicle configurations.
