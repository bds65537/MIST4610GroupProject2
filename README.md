## Description of Data Set:

The dataset our team selected comes from data.gov which is a US government website with a large catalog of datasets. Our dataset is the 2024 Fuel Economy Guide for the most common cars, SUVs, and trucks manufactured in 2024 driven in the United States, which includes domestic and foreign auto manufacturers. The database includes a wide variety of information for each manufacturer, division, and carline, which are all examples of string type data. Also, there are quantitative engine specifics like number of cylinders and intake/exhaust valves, numerical data. Additionally, the dataset lists city, highway, and combined fuel economy for each vehicle as advertised by the manufacturer, as well as drivetrain type and annual fuel cost. Finally, there is a column that lists the date the car was released, which is a date datatype. As a whole, the dataset offers comparable information on the different car manufacturers and how each has different numbers of vehicles with different specs, performance, and costs. 

## Question 1: How does the number of cylinders in the engine affect the fuel economy across different drivetrain types?

## Manipulations of the Dataset

The original dataset contained lots of surplus information with many null values which we cleaned up in Microsoft Excel before uploading to Tableau. First, our dataset contained information for electric and plug in hybrid vehicles, which our team omitted in our version dataset, focusing on the fuel economy comparisons of strictly gas-powered vehicles. Second, our team identified the columns with large amounts of null values and excluded those columns from our version of the dataset. Next, the dataset also had lots of information relating to environmental regulations, such as CO2 emission data which we also omitted from our dataset version. Finally, we limited our dataset to account for a few redundant dimensions, and our dataset was effectively complete. Still, the final version of our 2024 Fuel Economy dataset is certainly comprehensive, containing over 20 different car divisions, for gas powered cars, SUVs, and trucks manufactured in the year 2024.
